The repository is contained the several models as well as models tutorial. There are various kinds of works related such as:
* Time series model: It covers statistical analytics on time series data.
* Statistic analysis / technique: This provides useful / helpful statistical tasks that could be integrate in the models.
* Libraries tutorial: The useful python libraries provides as the tutorials, which is effortless to follow.
* Deployment: The branch to keep materials for ML Model deployment.
* Computer vision: It contained both of notebook file and branch realted to computer vision topic.
* Market risk: This is not my main area, which is credit risk. Thus, all related to market risks are placed under this topic.
* Customer and Marketing: Recently, it is better to know how to apply data science skills with marketing areas.
* PySpark: -soon-
* Natural language processing (NLP): -soon-
* Others: -soon-

There will be many more to come in the future.
